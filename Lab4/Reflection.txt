From working on this lab on using both the ruby and rust languages I preferred the ruby language. Ruby was really quick to start and get writing code and it was easy to understand. It is a multi paradigm object oriented scripting language and has great documentation on how to learn the language. Rust was a bit more difficult to learn but also had great documentation so it took more time to get started and learn. It is more strict and has primitive data types that need to be defined for memory safety. My favorite part of working with rust was the compiler was really helpful and easy to understand what the issues were and where they were happening. If I had to compare these languages to ones that I already know I would say Ruby is like Javascript in the way that it is easy to get started and you have alot of freedom in your code to do things how you want to, Rust is like C++ in the way that you have to define Primitive Types and the syntax are similar.
