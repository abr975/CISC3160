The utilities that I used for lab 2 were flex and bison. 
I chose to use these since I am on windows and the set up for it on windows seemed to be the quickest way.
I had to download both flex and bison off their websites, and I had to set up a environmental variable for the path.
Then I was good to go for creating my language.

My IDE of choice was Codeblocks since I had used this with C++ in a previous class,
and I saw I was going to be using the gcc which I was familiar with. 
So this made using the terminal enviorment easy since it was commands that I have used before. 

The Language that I chose to create so far is a basic language that can do two things.
This language can determine if a char input is either a consonant or a vowel in the alphabet.
Also it can determine if a number that you input is a prime number or a nonprime number. 
This language that I am creating is a functional language.
