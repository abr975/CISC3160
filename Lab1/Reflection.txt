For the reporting problem I chose to use python. The reason that I chose python language was because of the pandas library. Ive used this library before in CISC3440 Machine Learning
so I have some familiarity using it. It is real easy to work with csv files with the pd.read_csv and .sort_values. 

For the math calculation problem I chose to use javascript. Javascripts .map function was the reason that I chose to use javascript for this challenge since we are working with an 
array and using a formula on it we can use the .map function to return a new array with the formula for the conversions. Math.random is another feature of javascript that helped 
complete this task since we needed to predict weather for the next month and we can use that help get a prediction.

For the web development problem I chose to use the combination of javascript,html,css. I chose this because we needed to get something from an API and display it. Javascript has async 
functions and fetch which allow us to work with APIs. We needed to display this content to the screen in a nice way after so that is where both HTML and CSS come in handy.
