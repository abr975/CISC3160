For this Lab excerise I was using flex and bison, and ran into
a bug that was not giving any sort of error code and this took me
days to figure out but I eventually did. When I installed my flex and 
bison i was in C:User/ProgramFiles(x86)/GnuWin32 and for some reason
this caused a bug when I eventually changed it to C:User/GnuWin32 this
managed to fix the bug and I could get up and running with my code.

When I was finally able to get it working I created a calculator.l 
file I gave it the rules of a calculator that can have variables a-z and store
values with them. This has the basic + , - , *.
In Calculator.y I have the logic for + - * and the Calculator.

To compile I used
bison -y -d Calculator.y
flex calculator.l
gcc y.tab.c lex.yy.c
